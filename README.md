This is a forest fire simulation based on this [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBluLfX2F_k).
Simply change the WIDTH and HEIGHT to your desired simulation area and run it.

Green Pixel represent Trees. They spawn over time at random locations.
A lightning hits a random pixel every few frames and starts a fire.
The fire spreads to surrounding, touching trees and burns them down.

The purpose is.. well better watch the video, it explains it better than i could ever do :D
